# Revenue Distributor frontend

[RevenueDistributor.sol](https://github.com/iggy-social/iggy-contracts/blob/main/contracts/distributor/RevenueDistributor.sol) is a smart contract that can automate distributing revenue to select addresses.

Website: https://distributor.iggy.social/ 

> To see the UI, you can try this test smart contract on the Base network: [0xF1aB28FEfFB7E5BF34b03354267895516a0Cf9E9](https://distributor.iggy.social/?addr=0xF1aB28FEfFB7E5BF34b03354267895516a0Cf9E9).

If you don't have a `RevenueDistributor.sol` yet, create it via the website (find the Create button in the navigation bar).

Once your distributor smart contract is created, enter its address in the input field and click Load data. Then you can add recipients and managers.
